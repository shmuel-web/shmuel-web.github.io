Human Efficiency (Poem)

"
I stopped calling artificial intelligence
artificial intelligence
I call it intelligence
just intelligence
it's shorter
I don't have time and people don't have time
they understand what I'm talking about
and maybe it's not just shortening and human efficiency
maybe there's something else here
maybe intelligence is not really artificial
maybe it's the most real thing that happened to humanity
maybe it will free up time for all of us
and give all of us the ability to truly listen and understand
and discover wisdom
the wisdom that is revealed only after intelligence
"
