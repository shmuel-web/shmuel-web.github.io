### Turkish Coffee in an Espresso Cup ☕

![Turkish coffee](/content/blog/002/turky-coffee.jpeg)

I made myself a Turkish coffee in an espresso cup,  
and suddenly a thought came to me  
why don’t I drink espresso  
Or an Americano, like everyone else?

I just love Turkish coffee in a tiny cup.
But why?
Turkish coffee is something simple,  
something from the periphery, the coffee that simple pepole drink
Espresso, on the other hand, is elegant Italian, European, elite coffee

But in essence, it’s the same thing.  
It’s strong small coffee.  

And then I thought to myself  
I’m a bit like that too.  
A Turkish coffee in an espresso cup.
