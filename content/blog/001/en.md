### So why am I writing this blog

For a long time, I thought that Me and my ideas were a kind of *afterthought*.  
I’m not a rabbi,  
I’m not an academic,  
not really an entrepreneur,  
not fully religious, not fully secular,  
not part of the Tel Aviv elite, but also not exactly fitting into the periphery where I grew up and chose to live.

I became religious after serving in a combat unit.  
I studied in a Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) yeshiva, later in a Hasidic one following Rabbi Ashlag’s method, and then in a religious-Zionist yeshiva in Yad Binyamin.  
Financial pressures pushed me to seek a profession and give up my spiritual aspirations.  
By the time I realized that software and entrepreneurship were what I truly wanted to do, I was already a married kollel student with two children.  
I began studying independently and through courses until I finally got an opportunity — and suddenly, I was a high-tech professional,  
with an office overlooking the sea in Tel Aviv.

### From falling between the cracks to connecting the worlds

It may seem like success, but in truth, I always felt that I had fallen between the cracks.  
What did I do with my mind? I’m not a rabbi, not a researcher in computer science, not an entrepreneur — I never managed to raise an investment.  
Basically, I work in startups during the week and study Torah on Shabbat.

But then I began to experience genuine insights, and it hit me that I have a very unique lens on the world —  
and it’s not *by accident*; it’s **by design**.  
There’s something special and important that happens **precisely in the seams**, precisely in the movement between worlds.

In the inner dimension of Torah, there’s a subtle attribute called the *Sefira of Da’at* (Knowledge).  
But it’s not counted among the other Sefirot.  
It’s more of a *process* than a *state* — it truly lives *between worlds*,  
between the seven lower Sefirot and the three upper ones.  
It’s a motion that rises upward in order to bring down blessing.

For example — there’s science and there’s technology,  
and they’re not the same thing.  
Successful entrepreneurs are often people who can take a real-world problem, dive deep into scientific research and papers, and come back down with a practical solution that becomes technology everyone uses.  
That’s very different from when it goes *top-down*:  
someone from academia has a discovery and tries to turn it into an invention that solves real problems.

And here’s also an example from Torah.  
Moses grew up in Pharaoh’s palace — he surely learned wisdom from Egyptian magicians and overheard conversations among ministers and kings.  
Yet he was the son of slaves, not part of the elite he lived among,  
and he remained connected to his true identity.  
It was precisely from that place — between two worlds — that the leader emerged who brought a revolutionary message to humanity.

Even the Torah itself, if we think about it for a moment,  
is not just prophecy.  
It’s divine wisdom that rides on a **human invention** — writing,
